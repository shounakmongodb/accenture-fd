# 1. Objective  
## 1.1 Reason and Business Purposes  
Payment advice is a document sent by a customer to a supplier/vendor, informing the supplier/vendor that their
invoice/s have been paid. The Payment advice eases the process of matching invoices and payments for the
supplier and so are considered a useful service. It also works as a proof of payment received.  
**Requirement:**
The Payment Advice should be sent to the supplier/vendor in a specific format via email on the email address
maintained in the Vendor Master data.

## 1.2 Product Objective  
To send the status of invoice to vendors/suppliers, payment advice will be used. This will serve as the proof of
received payment.

## 1.3 Assumptions  
- A Payment advice is a notice of a payment to be made.  
- A Payment advice may cover one or more commercial trade transactions (and related financial
transactions), such as invoices, credit notes, debit notes, etc.  
- A Payment advice may include a cross reference to a Payment Order.  
- A single Payment advice may relate to both national and international settlements.  
- Each Payment advice shall be calculated in only one currency, even though the related transaction is
denominated in different currencies.  
- Each Payment advice shall relate to only one settlement date.  
- Either SAP User login language or vendor master communication language will derive the language in
which Remittance Form will be generated.  
- Client will ensure that a variant of the standard SAP program or custom program is created in the system
to conform to the Client format requirements.

# 2. Solution  
## 2.1 Process Flow  
2.2 Process Inputs  
Transaction: F110 and FBZ5.
Process Flow for generating the Payment Advice output:  
1. AP Processor will execute the Proposal run for open invoices based on parameters given in F110.  
2. Proposal run will be executed.  
3. Proposal generated by the system based on the parameters will be /can be edited by the AP processor.  
4. Payment run will be executed.  
5. On successful execution of the payment run, the payment will be processed, and the Payment output will
be generated in PDF format and will be sent out via email to the vendor.  
6. In case if the vendor email id is not maintained in the vendor master, the payment advice will only be
generated as a spool and will not be sent in a mail. To trace if the mail was sent or not, the user can logon
to the common mailbox maintained based on company code.
